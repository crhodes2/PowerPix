**How to use the PowerPix Application**

PowerPix is a small application that allow user to use the power of the Google Search Engine to search for images on certain topics and use said image to create a PowerPoint Presentation slide with that image.

At this time, this version of PowerPix is for **developers only** and would require the following:
 -Visual Studio 2019 (to run and test the program)
 -Microsoft Office 365 (most preferably MS PowerPoint)
 -Access to a Google Custom Search API key.

To get started:

-Download the project on GitHub -\&gt; [https://github.com/crhodes2/PowerPix](https://github.com/crhodes2/PowerPix)

-Save and unzip the project somewhere on your Desktop
